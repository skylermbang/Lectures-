# Gilded Rose Kata with Patterns

This demo is covered in this course:

[Pluralsight Design Patterns Overview](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/design-patterns-overview)

## Recommendation

Each step of the implementation and refactoring to apply each pattern is done as a separate commit. The commit history for this demo is in the [ardalis/gildedpatterns branch](https://github.com/ardalis/DesignPatternsInCSharp/tree/ardalis/gildedpatterns). You can use a tool like [githistory](https://github.githistory.xyz/ardalis/DesignPatternsInCSharp/blob/master/DesignPatternsInCSharp/KataWithPatterns/GildedRose.cs) to step through any particular file (though it's not as good as stepping through multiple files) and see how it evolved over time. You can use [your favorite git commit history viewer (like this one)](https://ardalis.com/git-graph-visualizes-branches-in-vs-code-for-free) to checkout each commit along the way and see what changed. Enjoy!
