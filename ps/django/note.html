     Django: Getting Started
### 2Django: Sratrgin a Django proejct ###
 Python Basic of HTML Django : Python web framework
ORM/Admin : powerful tools Template ,URL mapping, Forms , packages



python3 -m venv venv(virtual enviroment directory name) : create virtual enviroment
source venv(virtual enviroment directory name )/bin/activate


pip install django 

django-admin startproject meeting_planner : start project and create folder "meeting_planner"

cd meeting_planner
python mange.py runserver


--------------------------------------------------------------------
db.sqlite3 : db data base

__init__.py :  empty/ ? 

settings.py: where is the proejct is define / setting for the project

urls.py: assignes url

asgi.py , wsgi.py : deployment to the production server 
manage.py : 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3 Creating a Simple Web Page  ####    


create  app ? 

go to the project folder (meeting_planner)



python manage.py startapp app_name // you can make an app 



 => once you create the app you want to build , delte  admin.py, apps.py, models.py, tests.py (delete the migrataion file too)
   and go back to the main settings.py and add the app in the INSTALLED_APPa



first of all you have to make views.py 
     from django.http import HttpResponse

     def welcome(request):
    return HttpResponse("What sup this is skyler's django first page")

and urls.py :   you need to import the views and the function and map the url 
from website.views import welcome
    path('welcome.html', welcome)


    path('', welcome) // empty url for the main page

    1. make view function 
    2. import the function in the urls.py
    3. url mapping
    4. setting add the app 
    
    in the production  make sure you turn off the debug true

             1 web may consisted with mulitple apps

### 4 Setting up a Data Model  ####


Django model classes  

2core  concepts :      1. models  (python clases) mapped to database table
                       2. Migrations  (python scripts)  keep db structure in sync with code



Migration

python manage.py showmigrations ## show the migration needed 
python manage.py migrate ## migrate the thing and if you go to db.squlite3 its automaticlly updtated 


GO to model 
and write the class 


class Meeting(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    date = models.DateField()
after this you can 
python manage.py makemigrations ## to genearate   meetings/migrations/0001_initial.py file
python manage.py migrate



you can also change around in the admin page 
you need to go to admin.py 

and improt what you need to do .

from .models import Meeting
admin.site.register(Meeting)



## to make the super user in admin 
python.magage.py createsuperuser email/pwd


Django Models ;  saving python objects in a database 
                Models classesare mapped to tables 
                fields are mapped to clumns
                SQL is generated -  


for more django model fields - google 



what if you want to add "ROOM " in the model ?
you add the Class Room in the model 

To make things easy , you delete all the migratoin file + db.sqlite3 for the clean start 
but this makes you have to create the super user ide again 
*this is not good idea for the exisiting proejct that has lots data only recommend for the starting the new project 

so after delete you have to migrations 
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
